# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

To run project, open the folder in Visual Studio Code and then press "ctrl" + "'" together to open up the terminal. Once the terminal is open run "cd server" and then "node index". This will start the server.

Once you have completed this, you will need to run "cd client" and then "npm run dev". This will run the project locally on your machine.
